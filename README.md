# Awesome TensorFlow.js (#tfjs)

A curated list of awesome TensorFlow.js experiments, libraries, and projects. Inspired by [awesome-tensorflow](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow).

## What is TensorFlow.js?

TensorFlow.js is an open source software library to develop machine learning models in JavaScript, and use machine learning
(training and inference) directly in the browser or Node.js.
